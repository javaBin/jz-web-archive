	<h1>Partners</h1>
<p>
As a JavaZone partner, you have a unique opportunity to showcase your capabilities to developers, whether you are looking to build your brand, promote your products and services or create a forum for your developers. But participation in JavaZone is more than that: it is also a place where you yourself and your staff have access to valuable new knowledge from the world's most popular technology platforms. This reason alone makes JavaZone worth attending.
</p>
<p>
As a partner and exhibitor you will have a prominent role at the conference. Activities are not confined to the auditoria. In the exhibition space, we have organised a range of activities, from whiteboards, where speakers can expand on their presentations and answer questions arising from the presentation, to music and stand-up performances. And an array of other activities will contribute to making the exhibition space itself a key meeting place for conference participants.
</p>
<p>
Being a partner makes you part of a vibrant, dynamic community, helps you develop your professional environment, and offers your staff a valuable professional and social boost. The intensive and comprehensive programme offers your staff the opportunity to acquire useful skills and exchange experience with other software developers.
</p>
<p>
Registration for JavaZone partners opened in mid-February. Within a few days, 30 partners had joined up, and there has been a constant influx since then, but we still have a few places left. Act quickly to secure one of the remaining places.
</p>

<h2>Partner package</h2>

<p>JavaZone offers a comprehensive partner package including:</p>

<p>A new feature this year is non-personalised partner tickets allowing access to the exhibition space only.</p>

<h2>Branding</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Promotion in press coverage before, during and after the conference. JavaZone has a strong focus on promoting the partners in all media contact and through distribution of press releases and other press-related material. JavaZone will also be cooperating closely with the technical press in connection with the conference.</li>
	<li>Potential for individual exposure in the media: both the national daily press and technical press will be present and covering JavaZone.</li>
	<li>In teaser activities</li>
	<li>This year JavaZone features a new profile in the programme, auditoria, exhibition space and elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
